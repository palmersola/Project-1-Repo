# Welcome To Mars!

When the user enters the webpage they're given a title "Welcome To Mars".

The user is given a random image from our NASA API with given data.. which rover took the photo, the solar date since it had landed and the earth date (terrestrial date).

The user has the ability to browse random photos from the given date of the first photo shown if they click the button "Different photo from this date".

The user is also able to choose a new date and browse (at random) those photos as well.

If the user chooses a date that there were no photo's taken.. The user will be given a modal stating that no photos are available.. (this is currently not working and the system genorates another image from a different date.. assuimjing at random).

The web gets updated by new photos submited from the api. You will know that new photos have been submitted if the calendar updates to the current day.. if not.. the calendar will only show the date up until the last photos were submited.

The user also gets the ability to choose previous dates that they've submitted.

Below the mars api from nasa.. The user is given the current amount of people that are in space at the current time alone with their names and which space station they're in. We retreved this data from our second api (open-notify-api/ people in space).

Hope you enjoy!
